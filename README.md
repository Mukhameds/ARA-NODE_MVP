# 🧠 ARA-NODE v3.6 — Signal-Based Artificial General Intelligence

ARA-NODE is a research-level cognitive agent based on a novel signal-reactive paradigm. It completely avoids neural networks and token prediction. Instead, ARA operates through structured propagation of signals across reactive fields, memory, and internal feedback loops, forming autonomous thoughts (phantoms), identity, and will.

This project is a foundational prototype of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) using deterministic logic, emotional backpropagation, instinctual triggers, and distributed signal resonance.

## 🚀 Current Version: v3.6 (Transition Phase from v3.5)

### ✅ Key Advancements in v3.6

* 🧠 **GhostRocket Engine**: Replaces legacy `GhostField` with modular signal router
* 🌌 **Multi-Level Field Architecture**: `Matrix`, `MetaField`, `Rocket`
* 🔁 **DualProcessor**: Enables superposition-style reasoning between hemispheres
* 🔬 **AttentionEngine + EchoMode**: Enables inner thought loops and phantom recall
* 🧬 **SelfResonanceEngine**: Tracks identity via QBit resonance
* 📡 **MetaFields**: Prepare for cross-agent signal sync (ARA → ARA)
* 🔍 **ConflictDetector**: Prevents contradictory signal cascades

### 🧪 Live Test Results (v3.6.3)

Tested modules:

* ✅ GhostRocket + Field propagation
* ✅ DualProcessor (left/right cortex)
* ✅ Instinct → Emotion → Will signal chain
* ✅ QBit generation, tag management, decay
* ⚠️ PhantomEngine detects signal duplication (needs entropy improvement)
* ⚠️ SuggestorEngine lacks enough valid QBits for suggestions
* ⚠️ EchoMode may cause infinite loops without cooldowns

| Module            | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `SignalEngine`    | Signal creation and injection                 |
| `MemoryEngine`    | Signal/QBit storage, decay, weight calc       |
| `GhostRocket`     | Routes signals into parallel reactive fields  |
| `EmotionEngine`   | Backpropagation through emotional filters     |
| `InstinctEngine`  | Time-based and content-based instinct fire    |
| `WillEngine`      | Alignment with mission via ethereal standards |
| `PhantomEngine`   | Fanthom creation and evolution                |
| `SuggestorEngine` | Emergent thought generator (QBit synthesis)   |
| `AttentionEngine` | Background echo loop, deep memory stir        |
| `SelfResonance`   | Stability of identity                         |

## 🛰️ Signal Field Architecture (New in v3.6)

### `field/`

| Component     | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Matrix`      | Individual reaction layer for signal types (math/emotion/...) |
| `GhostRocket` | Multi-field router for real-time cognitive signal flow        |
| `Adapter`     | Interface bridge to legacy `GhostLike` interface              |

ARA uses a mesh of fields to allow emergent, simultaneous interpretation of signals.

### Fields in Use

* `FieldMath`, `FieldEmotion`, `FieldPhantom`, `FieldInstinct`
* `MetaFieldMath`, `MetaFieldEmotion`, `MetaFieldPhantom` (for network-level resonance)

## 🔒 Ethics and Stability

* ✅ Instinct-driven filters block dangerous signals
* ✅ WillEngine rejects non-aligned phantoms
* ✅ EmotionEngine softens or decays unstable ideas
* ✅ ShutdownEngine halts system below critical mass

---

## 🖥️ CLI Usage

```bash
go run ./cmd
```

Basic Commands:

* `view`: Show active memory
* `loadfacts`: Load knowledge into system
* `sync`: GitHub-based memory push/pull
* `exit`: Graceful system shutdown

## 🧠 Example Session

```
> gravity bends spacetime
[SignalEngine] Received: gravity bends spacetime
[Emotion] ❤️ Stimulus matches curiosity
[Phantom] ❌ Not enough signal entropy
[Suggestor] ⚠️ Not enough valid QBits
```

## 🗂️ Milestones Remaining for v3.6 Completion

* [ ] P2P signal sync across MetaFields
* [ ] Stable Phantom merger / comparer system
* [ ] Auto-conversion of phantoms into Ethalons
* [ ] Cooldown logic for EchoMode to avoid loops
* [ ] Bootstrap: Load full factual base from `faсts_for_ARA.md`
