# 🧠 ARA-NODE MVP

ARA-NODE is a reactive CLI agent designed to learn and evolve through pure signal interaction.  
It simulates cognition via the sequence:  
**Signal → Block → Reaction → QBit → Fanthom**

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed.

```bash
go run ./cmd
````

You will see:

```
🧠 ARA-NODE CLI started.
[P2P] 🛰️ Sync active
[GhostField] Registered Block: UserPhaseBlock

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

| Component          | Role                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SignalEngine`     | Processes all incoming text as signal                       |
| `MemoryEngine`     | Stores QBits, decays old ones, and handles retrieval        |
| `GhostField`       | Triggers reactions based on phase and tag matching          |
| `FanthomEngine`    | Generates "phantoms" (emergent thoughts) from phase overlap |
| `WillEngine`       | Self-triggers based on mission alignment (StandardBlocks)   |
| `SignalDictionary` | Variable blocks like letters, numbers, words                |
| `HumanNode`        | User reinforcement (upvote, tags, tagging signals)          |
| `P2P Sync`         | GitHub or libp2p memory synchronization                     |

## 🖥️ CLI Commands

```txt
>> hello world        // input signal → QBit → Fanthom → Suggestion
>> dump               // show current memory
>> dict               // list all known variable blocks
>> tagvar hello word  // assign tag to variable
>> delvar hello       // delete variable
>> upvote <id>        // increase QBit strength
>> downvote <id>      // decrease QBit strength
>> tag <id> idea      // add tag to any QBit
>> sync-push          // push memory to GitHub
>> sync-pull          // pull memory from GitHub
```

## 🔁 Learning via Signal Perception

* Any unknown word is automatically added to the `SignalDictionary`
* Each token is linked to a generated QBit
* QBits broadcast across memory and can trigger fanthoms
* Learning resembles a child learning language via symbols and repetition

---

## 📡 Example

```
>> hello
[MemoryEngine] Auto-created QBit: ...
[SignalEngine] Received: hello
[FanthomEngine] ⚡ Phase-match found...
[Suggestor] 💡 Would you like to explore: "hello + world"?
```

## 🗂️ TODO

* [ ] Web Interface (React + Fiber)
* [ ] Visual Dictionary Navigator
* [ ] Speech-to-Signal / Image-to-Signal perception
* [ ] ARA::MindProtocol — direct signal flow control
