# 🧠 ARA-NODE v3.5

ARA-NODE is an advanced cognitive agent built on reactive signal-based logic, entirely avoiding traditional neural network architectures. It learns, reasons, and evolves by structured signal propagation, resonance, and emotional backpropagation.

## 🚀 Current State: Version 3.5

The system has reached a stable and fully integrated state, with key improvements to signal processing, phantom generation, emotional control, and ethical constraints:

### ✅ Stable Modules

* **SignalEngine**: Processes and routes signals effectively into system memory.
* **EmotionEngine**: Enhances QBits through emotion-based backpropagation.
* **InstinctEngine**: Manages basic safety instincts, ensuring system stability and ethical compliance.
* **WillEngine**: Controls signal acceptance and phantom generation aligned with core mission and ethical principles.
* **PhantomEngine**: Robust management of phantom signals, avoiding cyclical and redundant thought loops.
* **AttentionEngine**: Background thought generation based on resonance and signal strength.
* **MemoryEngine**: Efficient storage, decay, merging, and retrieval of QBits.

### 🚧 Recently Added Components

* **WordFormationEngine**: Forms stable words from signals, mimicking natural language acquisition.
* **ShutdownEngine**: Reactive system that gracefully deactivates modules if overall signal strength critically declines.
* **HumanNodeEngine**: Integrates user feedback to refine learning via upvotes, downvotes, and tags.

## 🔒 Ethics and Safety

* Robust instinct-driven blocking of unethical signals (violence, self-harm, destruction).
* Emotion-based filters that prevent generation of potentially harmful or destructive phantom signals.

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

| Component          | Role and Functionality                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.go`          | System entry point and module orchestration           |
| `SignalDictionary` | Fundamental perceptual units (letters, words, images) |
| `ResonanceMatrix`  | Tracks associative strength between QBits             |
| `DecayAnalysis`    | Periodically removes weak or irrelevant signals       |
| `ReflexEngine`     | Handles immediate responses to critical signals       |
| `PredictionEngine` | Generates predictions based on historical signal data |
| `QBitEvolution`    | Manages QBit lifecycle and progression                |

## 🖥️ CLI Interface

ARA-NODE provides a comprehensive CLI for interaction and system management:

```bash
go run ./cmd
```

Basic commands:

* `view`: Display current memory
* `sync`: Initiate memory synchronization
* `loadfacts`: Load structured knowledge into memory
* `exit`: Terminate the system gracefully

## 📡 Example Session

```
>> hello world
[SignalEngine] Received: hello world
[EmotionEngine] ❤️ +joy
[PhantomEngine] 🔮 Phantom QBit generated successfully
[WillEngine] ✅ Accepted: signal aligned with standards
```

## 🗂️ Next Steps & Roadmap

* 🔲 Further stabilization of the PhantomEngine
* 🔲 Integration of structured fact knowledge (`core_knowledge.json`)
* 🔲 Stress-testing ShutdownEngine
* 🔲 Continuous refinement of WordFormationEngine outputs
