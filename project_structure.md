# üìÅ ARA-NODE System Structure

## üß† Overview

ARA-NODE is a reactive cognitive agent based on the paradigm: **Signal ‚Üí Block ‚Üí Reaction**. The system is built in modular Go code with a clean CLI entry point, autonomous memory, emotion, instinct, will, and phantom logic.

## üìÅ Project Directory

### `C:\Documents\ARA-NODE_mvp\`

Root folder of the project.

### üîß `cmd/`

* `main.go` ‚Äî CLI entry point, connects all modules, handles user input, emits signals, processes loops.

### ‚öôÔ∏è `config/`

* `manifest.go` ‚Äî SelfKernel: immutable identity of the agent (ID, mission, architect, time of birth).

### üß† `core/` ‚Äî Core signal architecture

| `prediction.go`            | Basic prediction engine using primitive chains.            |
| `standards.go`             | Standard mission blocks and keyword matching.              |
| `bootstrap.go`             | Initial user interview: purpose, interests, profile.       |
| `types.go`                 | Core types: Signal, QBit, Reaction, PhantomLog, etc.       |
| `helpers.go`               | Utility functions (phase diff, tag removal, etc).          |

### üî¨ `internal/` ‚Äî Interface, I/O, Extensions

| File                          | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `phantom.go`                  | Phantom generation, merging, decay, deep memory.    |
| `phantom_tree.go`             | Console tree display of phantom source chains.      |
| `suggestor.go`                | SuggestorEngine: idea proposal from QBit chains.    |
| `p2p_sync.go`                 | libp2p: P2P discovery, stream sync, memory merge.   |
| `github_sync.go`              | GitHub memory sync via msgpack and `git push/pull`. |
| `human_node.go`               | User feedback: upvote, downvote, tag QBits.         |
