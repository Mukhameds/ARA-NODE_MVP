# 📁 ARA-NODE v3.5 — System Structure

## 🧠 Overview

ARA-NODE v3.5 is an advanced reactive cognitive agent built around the paradigm:

```
Signal → Block → Reaction → Memory → Phantom
```

The system integrates emotional, instinctive, volitional, and phantom-driven logic for autonomous cognition and adaptive learning. Fully modularized in Go, it offers a clear CLI entry point, reactive architecture, and user-driven memory management.

## 📁 Project Directory Structure

### 🔧 CLI Entry Point (`cmd/`)

* **`main.go`**: Entry point; orchestrates modules, handles user inputs, processes system loops, and triggers reactions.

### ⚙️ System Configuration (`config/`)

* **`manifest.go`**: Defines the immutable core identity and mission of the agent (`SelfKernel`).

### 🧠 Core Modules (`core/`)
