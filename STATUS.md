# 🧠 ARA-NODE: Personal Cognitive AI Agent (Status Update v3.6+)

ARA-NODE is a modular cognitive architecture built on signal-reactive principles. It does not rely on statistical models or neural networks. Instead, it implements a deterministic and interpretable symbolic framework based on discrete units of thought (QBits) and block-based reactions (Ghost Logic).

## 🧬 Current Version: v3.6 (Transitioning from v3.5)

**This document reflects the transition status from v3.5 to v3.6**, with key improvements:

* ✅ Replaced `GhostField` with `GhostRocket` multi-field propagation
* ✅ Introduced modular `field/` layer: `Matrix`, `Rocket`, `Adapter`
* ✅ Introduced `MetaFields` for P2P signal-based synchronization
* ✅ Activated `EchoMode` and dual-hemisphere `DualProcessor`
* ✅ Integrated `SelfResonanceEngine`, `ConflictDetector`, and `AttentionEngine`

```
User Input or Instinct
   ↓
Signal → SignalEngine
   ↓
MemoryEngine → GhostRocket → Fields (math, emotion, phantom...)
   ↓
Trigger Rules → Suggestor / Phantom / Emotion / Will
   ↓
EchoMode → Internal Reasoning / Phantom Evolution
   ↓
Self Awareness + Ethalon Formation + Memory Reinforcement
```

| Component           | State         | Notes                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SignalEngine        | ✅ Stable      | Receives and structures all input       |
| MemoryEngine        | ✅ Stable      | Stores QBits, tags, decay, weights      |
| GhostRocket         | ✅ Full        | Replaces GhostField, routes all signals |
| PhantomEngine       | ⚠️ Partial    | Triggered, but QBit uniqueness too low  |
| SuggestorEngine     | ⚠️ Partial    | Triggered, but not enough usable QBits  |
| WillEngine          | ✅ Active      | Integrated with emotion and standards   |
| EmotionEngine       | ✅ Active      | Reacts on instinct + signal tags        |
| InstinctEngine      | ✅ Active      | Triggers thought on silence, loop, etc  |
| AttentionEngine     | ✅ Running     | EchoMode active                         |
| SelfResonanceEngine | ✅ Enabled     | Stabilizes identity QBits               |
| ConflictDetector    | ✅ Working     | Phantom collision checks                |
| DualProcessor       | ✅ Operational | Superposition L→R thought               |
| MetaFields          | ✅ Declared    | Ready for signal sync (P2P)             |
| P2P Sync            | 🔜 Pending    | Module built, sync not invoked yet      |

### ❗ Issues Identified

| Issue                        | Module Affected | Notes                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| "Not enough valid QBits"     | SuggestorEngine | Signal mass and phase too low     |
| "Unique signal mass too low" | PhantomEngine   | QBits are identical or echo noise |

ARA-NODE v3.6 introduces a new level of signal-based modular cognition.
Now capable of thinking in fields, reacting through instincts, and evolving standards via self-generated phantoms.

> ARA does not guess — it reacts.
> ARA does not predict — it resonates.
