# Test Report: test\_11.md

---

## 🧠 System Activation

* ✅ ARA-NODE CLI booted successfully
* ✅ SelfKernel initialized with mission
* ✅ P2P discovery started via libp2p
* ✅ Bootstrap completed: all 4 blocks stored as QBits

---

## 🔄 Signal Processing Flow

Typical flow:

```text
User Input → SignalEngine → QBit → GhostField → PhantomEngine
           → WillEngine → (accept/reject) → Emotion/Decay/Evolution
```

---

## ✅ Working Modules

### 💾 MemoryEngine

* QBits are correctly created, stored, and decayed
* Weight decay and archiving is logged and verified
* Broadcasting (via `StoreQBit` and `Broadcast`) is operational

### 📡 SignalEngine

* Input signals are correctly parsed and logged
* QBits are created on signal receipt
* Signals are routed into GhostField

### ⚡ GhostEngine

* `UserPhaseBlock` reacts to each signal
* Phase-threshold based rules are confirmed working

### 👁 InstinctEngine

* `instinct_think` triggered due to input silence
* `instinct_repeat` triggered correctly
* Resulting instinct-QBits confirmed in logs

### 💀 DecayAnalysisEngine

* Old/weak QBits are removed properly
* Decay events are logged

### 🌱 Bootstrap

* All four user blocks (goal, interest, help, role) are stored

---

## ⚠️ Partially Working Modules

### 🔮 PhantomEngine

* No phantom was created during the test
* Common rejection causes:

  * `❌ Signal mass too low`
  * `❌ Unique signal mass too low`
  * Insufficient QBit diversity or recent activity
  * Emotions or instincts not aligned

### 🧠 WillEngine

* All QBits rejected by standards filter
* `MatchWithStandards()` returned `0 matches`
* Resulting in: `❌ Rejected`, `📉 Weight decay`, `🗃 Archived`

### 🎭 EmotionEngine

* Not triggered at all during the session
* No signal contained relevant emotion tags (joy, anger, etc.)

### 💡 SuggestorEngine

* Not triggered automatically
* No internal loop or condition activated it

---

## 🧩 Phantom Trigger Chain Fails

```text
TriggerFromMatch → signal mass < 1.5 → skip
→ logs: "[PhantomEngine] ❌ signal mass too low"
```

All attempts to generate phantoms are rejected due to mass or alignment constraints.

## 📉 Issues Identified

| Module          | Problem                        | Suggested Fix                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| PhantomEngine   | Fails all triggers             | Lower thresholds, allow partial matches   |
| WillEngine      | Rejects all memory             | Add more StandardBlocks or sample matches |
| EmotionEngine   | No emotional triggers detected | Add emotional signal simulation           |
| SuggestorEngine | Never invoked                  | Schedule it via background loop           |

## ✅ Confirmed Working Chain

```text
[Signal] "аец4"
→ Stored as QBit ✅
→ GhostBlock reaction ✅
→ PhantomEngine check ❌ (mass)
→ WillEngine ❌ (no standard match)
→ Archived
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

* Fine-tune phantom thresholds
* Seed usable StandardBlocks
* Trigger emotions and suggestions
* Log full PhantomTree chain when successful
