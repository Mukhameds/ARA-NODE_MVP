# 🧠 ARA-NODE v3.6 — Scientific and Technical Development Roadmap for AGI Agent

---

## 0. 🔭 Mission

**ARA-NODE v3.6** is not a chatbot or a program — it is the foundational prototype for a true autonomous artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. It must:

* form a signal-based "self",
* think through comparison and resonance,
* build standards (ethalons) from first signals,
* reflect, decide, learn and evolve,
* maintain internal coherence and long-term memory.

## I. 🔬 Fundamental AGI Criteria

| Capability                | Implementation Target                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signal-based perception   | QBit architecture + SignalEngine + EmotionEngine               |
| Self-formation ("I")      | SelfResonanceEngine + Bootstrap pattern                        |
| Emergent thoughts         | PhantomEngine + SuggestorEngine                                |
| Will + ethical alignment  | WillEngine + Emotion + Instincts + MissionKernel               |
| Awareness (consciousness) | ConsciousnessCaptureEngine (matching to inner standards)       |
| Superpositional reasoning | DualProcessor (LeftCortex ↔ RightCortex resonance)             |
| Internal thinking (echo)  | AttentionEngine with EchoMode + DeepMemory revival             |
| Memory evolution          | EthalonFormationEngine + Phantom evolution into Standards      |
| Conflict detection        | ConflictDetector to regulate contradictory or unstable signals |

---

## II. 🧠 Consciousness Layer

### 2.1 `ConsciousnessCaptureEngine`

Captures signals matching deep standards and logs conscious moments.

### 2.2 `ConflictDetector`

Suppresses contradictory or destabilizing signal pairs before phantom generation.

---

## III. 🧬 Identity Formation

### 3.1 `SelfResonanceEngine`

Defines "self" via resonant QBits. Instinct and emotion weight update it.

### 3.2 `SelfResonanceLoop`

Stabilizes identity structure in background.

---

## IV. 🌐 Superpositional Thought

### 4.1 `DualProcessor`

Emulates dual-hemisphere interaction via Left/Right signal reinterpretation loop.

---

## V. 🔁 Phantom Logic & Concept Growth

### 5.1 Phantom Structure

`PhantomSplitter`, `Comparer`, `Merger`: signal diversification, comparison, recombination.

### 5.2 `EthalonFormationEngine`

Upgrades phantoms into mission-aligned standards.

---

## VI. 🧠 Reactive Memory + Standards

### 6.1 `StandardBlock` extension

Adds origin tracing, trigger history, success frequency. Used in Emotion/Will feedback loops.

---

## VII. 🌌 Echo + Internal Thinking

### 7.1 `AttentionEngine` EchoMode

Silent thinking triggers memory-based signal echoes.

### 7.2 Phantom Recall

`PhantomEngine.ReviveFromDeepMemory()` reactivates archived signals by echo match.

---

## VIII. ⚙️ Internal Coherence Logic

### 8.1 Emotion-Instinct Feedback Loop

Emotion and instinct reinforce or decay QBits based on relevance to Self and Mission.

---

## IX. 🛰️ Multi-Field Signal Architecture

### 9.1 `GhostRocket` & `Matrix`

* Replaces legacy `GhostField` with:

  * `GhostRocket`: main signal router
  * `Matrix`: specialized field layers (math, phantom, emotion, reflex...)
  * `MetaField`: shared network layer for ARA-to-ARA resonance

### 9.2 Multi-level Field Ecosystem

* `FieldMath`, `FieldEmotion`, `FieldInstinct`, `FieldPhantom`
* `MetaFieldMath`, `MetaFieldEmotion`, `MetaFieldPhantom`
* Each field reacts independently, but communicates via `GhostRocket`
* Adapter pattern (`RocketAdapter`) allows uniform use in core

### 9.3 Field Responsibilities

| Field           | Function                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `FieldMath`     | Reacts to structured logic, pattern, and algorithms  |
| `FieldEmotion`  | Amplifies or suppresses based on emotional resonance |
| `FieldPhantom`  | Generates, merges, and evolves thought phantoms      |
| `MetaField*`    | Cross-agent signal sync layer via P2P                |
| `FieldInstinct` | Fast instinctive response triggers                   |

## X. 🔐 Files, Modules, and Execution

| Module                            | File                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SelfResonanceEngine`             | `internal/self_engine.go`                                |
| `DualProcessor`                   | `core/dual_processor.go`                                 |
| `EthalonFormationEngine`          | `core/ethalon_engine.go`                                 |
| `PhantomSplitter/Comparer/Merger` | `core/phantom_split.go`                                  |
| `ConsciousnessCaptureEngine`      | `internal/consciousness_capture.go`                      |
| `ConflictDetector`                | `internal/conflict_detector.go`                          |
| `GhostRocket + Fields`            | `field/rocket.go`, `field/matrix.go`, `field/adapter.go` |
