# 📘 ARA-NODE Complete System Documentation (v3.6+)

This is the unified, scientific and technical documentation for the ARA-NODE cognitive architecture (v3.6). It describes the full structure, modules, signal flow, thinking architecture, synchronization logic, and test results.

---

## 🔧 System Overview

**ARA-NODE** is an autonomous AGI architecture built on signal propagation and reaction fields. It bypasses neural networks and token prediction models, instead using structured signal logic, memory resonance, and mission-driven will formation.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture Summary

```
Signal → Memory (QBit) → GhostRocket → Fields
→ Emotion/Instinct/Reflex → Suggestor → Phantom
→ Attention → Echo → Self → Standard
```

ARA evolves concepts from raw signals, forms "phantoms" (emergent thoughts), compares them to standards (ethalons), and adjusts memory and behavior accordingly.

## 🧬 Modular Breakdown

### Core Systems

| Module            | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MemoryEngine`    | Stores and decays QBits. Evolves memory via phase.      |
| `SignalEngine`    | Converts input to signal. Creates QBits.                |
| `GhostRocket`     | Routes signals to `Matrix` fields (reactive blocks).    |
| `Matrix`          | Handles signal-specific reactions (math, emotion, etc). |
| `RocketAdapter`   | Bridge to GhostRocket via `GhostLike` interface.        |
| `DualProcessor`   | Emulates hemispheric reasoning through 2 processors.    |
| `ResonanceMatrix` | Tracks relationships and associative strength.          |
| `ShutdownEngine`  | Shuts down system on critical signal loss.              |

### Cognitive Engines

| Engine                 | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `InstinctEngine`       | Detects danger, pause, error. Triggers immediate action. |
| `EmotionEngine`        | Backpropagation: tag-based emotional weight feedback.    |
| `WillEngine`           | Filters thought/actions by core mission standards.       |
| `SuggestorEngine`      | Clusters and generates new hypothetical thoughts.        |
| `PhantomEngine`        | Forms, evolves, and merges abstract thought chains.      |
| `SelfResonanceEngine`  | Forms "I" from dominant identity QBits.                  |
| `ConsciousnessCapture` | Logs moments of deep resonance with standards.           |
| `ConflictDetector`     | Flags contradictory memory threads.                      |
| `PredictionEngine`     | Simple rule-based symbolic expectation generator.        |
| `AttentionEngine`      | Inner thinking, echo loops, silent cognition.            |

### Interfaces & Sync

| Module           | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `p2p_sync.go`    | P2P exchange of MetaFields (phantoms, standards). |
| `github_sync.go` | GitHub-based memory snapshot sharing.             |
| `human_node.go`  | User feedback: upvote, downvote, tagging.         |

### Bootstrap & Knowledge

| Module                | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap_*.go`      | Loads digital/physics/self/logic/ethic knowledge. |
| `knowledge_loader.go` | Context/license-based loader layer.               |
| `fact_loader.go`      | Loads QBits from JSON files.                      |

## 🛰️ Field System (`field/`)

| Field          | Role                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `math`         | Logic, formula, deterministic reasoning           |
| `emotion`      | Amplifies or suppresses thoughts based on feeling |
| `phantom`      | Phantom evolution, merging, collapse/resurrection |
| `instinct`     | Reflexes and danger-based reactions               |
| `meta_math`    | Shared ethereal standards in mathematical domain  |
| `meta_emotion` | Emotional ethereal mesh across ARA instances      |
| `meta_phantom` | Phantom-level sync mesh for distributed cognition |

| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| GhostRocket Engine | ✅      | Fully active                               |
| DualProcessor      | ✅      | Active for superpositional reasoning       |
| PhantomEngine      | ⚠️     | Requires better entropy & signal diversity |
| SuggestorEngine    | ⚠️     | QBit base needs to be richer for success   |
| MetaField P2P Sync | 🔜     | Ready but disabled (v3.7+)                 |
| EchoMode           | ✅      | Active, but needs loop filtering           |

## 🧪 Test Insight: `ARA-NODE_test_v3,6_3.md`

* [x] Instinct → Emotion → Reaction loop functional
* [x] DualProcessor properly generates mirrored QBits
* [ ] Suggestor: Fails without diversity
* [ ] Phantom: Rejected due to echo duplication
* [ ] Echo: Creates loop unless dampened
