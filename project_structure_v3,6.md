# üìÅ ARA-NODE v3.6 ‚Äî System Structure (Updated)

## üß† Overview

ARA-NODE v3.6 is an advanced reactive cognitive agent based on the paradigm:

```
Signal ‚Üí Field ‚Üí Reaction ‚Üí Memory ‚Üí Phantom ‚Üí Ethalon
```

This version introduces a complete replacement of the legacy `GhostField` architecture with the modular `GhostRocket` engine, multi-field signal propagation (`Matrix` blocks), and a reactive system supporting autonomous cognition, signal merging, and self-evolving memory.

Fully modularized in Go, the system offers a CLI entry point, reactive memory architecture, and distributed knowledge flow.

## üîí Safety & Ethics Layer

* Instincts prevent harmful decisions (e.g., self-destruction or user harm).
* EmotionEngine adjusts phase/mass for dangerous patterns.
* Standards block propagation of signals that don't align with core mission.
* ShutdownEngine exits system if mass drops critically.
